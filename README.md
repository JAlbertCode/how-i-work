# 🧭 How to Work With Me

Hi! I am Jay and I’m a DevRel Engineer with a background in full-stack AI development, Web3 gaming, dApps, and smart contracts. I thrive at the intersection of technical depth and community impact, turning complex tech into things people can actually use, enjoy, and build on. I’m based in the U.S. (Eastern Time) and split my time between building, experimenting, and connecting with developers. I’m energized by creative problem-solving, finding unconventional solutions, and helping others unlock their own capabilities.

## 🧭 My Guiding Principles

- Practical Impact – I focus on solutions that actually ship and make a difference.
- Experimentation – I’d rather test quickly, learn, and adapt than get stuck in endless planning.
- Transparency – I share context early, including uncertainties, so we can solve problems together.
- Empowerment – Every interaction should leave people feeling more capable than before.
- Curiosity – I dig deep, ask hard questions, and connect seemingly unrelated dots into a clear strategy.
- Ambition – I want to work with people who dream big and aim to blow people’s minds, not just deliver, but redefine what’s possible.

## 🧠 How I Think and Make Decisions

- I move fast when I have enough information, but I’m deliberate with decisions that set long-term direction.
- I think in terms of both the strategic “why” and the tactical “how.”
- I keep my focus on solutions over the blame game when things go wrong. Blame me, then let’s move forward.

## 💬 Communication Preferences

- Slack for day-to-day, async updates, and quick feedback.
- Tag me or DM me for anything urgent—otherwise, threads are great.
- I’m happy to hop on a call for complex or ambiguous topics that need fast resolution.
- I aim to respond quickly during work hours, but I don’t expect anyone to be “always on.”

## 🤝 How I Like to Collaborate

- I’m comfortable iterating in public and adjusting as we go.
- Brainstorming works best when we start broad, then converge on something we can test or ship.
- I welcome direct, constructive feedback and will always give it in return.
- I value ambition and high standards. Our work should inspire, educate, and challenge people to think bigger.

## 📆 Calls With Me

- Bring challenges, wins, blockers, or ideas to explore.
- I prefer to leave calls with clear next steps or decisions.

## 🔁 Feedback Culture

- Direct, constructive, and actionable feedback is best.
- I give feedback quickly, in context, so it’s easier to act on.
- I receive feedback best when it’s specific, honest, and outcome-focused.
- I’m not precious about ideas—if something isn’t working, I’d rather improve it than defend it. If we're not honest, we're only lying to ourselves

## 📚 What I’m Working On / Learning

- Building and promoting ZK Dapps examples
- Scaling developer onboarding, education, and engagement strategies for Web3.
- Building reusable frameworks and automation systems for DevRel workflows.
- Exploring the practical edges of decentralized infrastructure.

## ✨ Things That Make Me Happy

- Seeing ideas go from “what if” to “live in the wild.”
- Inspiring others to action.
- Recognition from the developer community.
- Building and prototyping

## 🚫 Things That Frustrate Me

- Unclear priorities or shifting goals without context.
- Long delays in surfacing blockers.
- Overcomplicating simple solutions.
- Endless discussion without a path to execution.
- Feedback that’s vague or disconnected from outcomes.
